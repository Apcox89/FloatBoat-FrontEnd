        <p>Essential boat maintenance goes beyond a visual inspection of your boat every time you head out. 
          Youâ€™ll also want to care for your boat after every outing, as well as follow a regular maintenance schedule. </p>

        <p class="mb-0">Fortunately, many upkeep-related tasks are manageable for most boat owners and do not require a mechanic. 
          However, if you do find you need assistance or a major repair, we recommend turning to the us so you can enjoy your boat safely.
